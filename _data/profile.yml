    Hi, I am Son Nguyen, an AI Research Resident at the <a href="https://fptsoftware.com/">FPT Software AI Center</a>, working under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJe1704AAAAJ">Dr. Van Nguyen</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JiKBo6UAAAAJ&hl=vi">Prof. Truong-Son Hy</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ck0k_UAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ngan Le</a>.
    I received my B.Sc. degree in Data Science from the <a href="https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/">University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (HCMUS-VNU HCMC)</a>, in 2024, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aVmva7MAAAAJ&hl=vi">Dr. Tung Le</a>. <br>
    My research interests include multimodal learning and generative models, particularly text-to-audio generation, video-to-speech synthesis, and visual voice cloning.
    I am also interested in medical imaging, with a focus on vision-language models and image synthesis.
